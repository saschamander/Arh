# ARH Fan Update

Updated Arh WoW addon. This is a fan-maintained update.

[Old Version on Curse](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/arh)

### Archaeology Helper accelerates your surveying by providing triangulation on a Heads-Up Display (HUD)
- Survey 
- Green, yellow, or red button to add new sector to the HUD and narrow down the position of your fragment
- HUD optionally includes GatherMate2 pins showing possible fragment positions, further accelerating the process
- Shows Dig Sites on Battlefield Minimap
- Keybindings and various settings

### HUD
On the HUD you can also see player arrow in the center and very small red circle that represents survey success range. And ofc all colored transparent overlapping areas that were set by you with colored buttons.

### Instructions
1. Go to dig site, Right Click last button (spade) to show HUD and Left Click to cast Survey. 
2. ROTATE YOUR CHAR, BUT DON'T MOVE in the needed direction and press colored button according to Survey result. 
3. Move to other location, do same again.
- It is strongly recommended to use in conjunction with GatherMate2, which will show all previous or imported dig-points on the HUD. When using GatherMate2 jump onto fragment before gathering! GatherMate2 data accuracy depends on that. Minimap zoom buttons also zoom the HUD display.

### Controls
- Left Click main window to move it
- Right Click main window: opens config

- Left Click on colored button: adds new sector to the HUD
- Right Click on colored button: temporarily hide/show that color

- Arrow button: undo last sector

- Left Click spade: cast Survey
- Right Click spade: show/hide the HUD
- Middle Click spade: open Archaeology window

- Use "/arh" for command line help
